Class Names
Name the class after what it is. If you can't think of what it is that is a clue you have not 
thought through the design well enough.
Compound names of over three words are a clue your design may be confusing various entities in 
your system. Revisit your design. Try a CRC card session to see if your objects have more 
responsibilities than they should.
Avoid the temptation of bringing the name of the class a class derives from into the derived 
class's name. A class should stand on its own. It doesn't matter what it derives from.
Suffixes are sometimes helpful. For example, if your system uses agents then naming something 
DownloadAgent conveys real information.
